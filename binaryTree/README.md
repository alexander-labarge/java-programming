GitHub Copilot: Here's an outline of the steps you can take to implement the program:

1. Create a GUI using Java Swing that allows the user to input a binary tree in the specified format.
2. When the "Make Tree" button is clicked, parse the input string and construct the binary tree using the BinaryTree class.
3. Implement the BinaryTree class, which should contain a static nested class to define the nodes of the binary tree, together with a constructor that is called when the Make Tree button is clicked and is supplied the string representation of the tree and constructs the actual tree from that string.
4. Implement public methods in the BinaryTree class that are called when each of the remaining six buttons are clicked. All of those public methods should have corresponding private methods that accomplish their tasks using recursion.
5. Implement the InvalidTreeSyntax class, which defines a checked exception. It should be thrown when an invalid string is supplied and the Make Tree button is clicked. It should be caught in the main class and a JOptionPane window should be displayed that describes the reason for the invalid syntax.

Here's an example implementation of the BinaryTree class in Java:
