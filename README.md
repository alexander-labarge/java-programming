# Binary Tree GUI

This is a Java program that allows you to create and visualize binary trees using a graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows you to input a binary tree using a string representation, and then displays the tree using a variety of different visualization methods.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `BinaryTreeGUI.java` file using the `javac` and `java` commands. This will open the GUI window, which allows you to input a binary tree using a string representation.

You can input a binary tree using the following format:

```
(A(B(C)(D))(E(F)(G)))
```

This string represents the following binary tree:

```
     A
   /   \
  B     E
 / \   / \
C   D F   G
```

Once you have input a binary tree, you can visualize the tree using the following methods:

- **In-order traversal**: Displays the nodes of the tree in in-order traversal order.
- **Pre-order traversal**: Displays the nodes of the tree in pre-order traversal order.
- **Post-order traversal**: Displays the nodes of the tree in post-order traversal order.
- **Layer tree**: Displays the nodes of the tree at each level, in a list format.

To visualize the tree using one of these methods, simply click the corresponding button in the GUI window.
